The next highest category was average, with 70 students reporting this option.\nTwo-way table: Health Status and Family Relationship A total of 63 students reported their health as very good AND their family relationships as good. (Rows represent health while columns represent family relationship.)\nThree-way table: Health Status,Family Relationship, and Going Out with Friends The first value in the first table that prints out is 0. This means that among students that report going out as very low, 0 reported their health status as very bad and their family relations as very bad. The last value from the last table is 7. Among students that reported going out with friends as very high, 7 reported both their health status and family relations as very good.\n\n\nCreate a conditional two-way table using table(). That is, condition on one variable’s setting and create a two-way table. Do this using two different methods:\n– Once, by subsetting the data (say with filter()) and then creating the two-way table\n\n# subsetting the data and then creating the two-way table\ntable(student_combF$healthF[student_combF$sex == \"F\"],\n  student_combF$famrelF[student_combF$sex == \"F\"])\n\n               \n                1 - very bad 2 - bad 3 - average 4 - good 5 - very good\n  1 - very bad             2       1           3       10            12\n  2 - bad                  0       1           6       14             2\n  3 - average              0       4           8       17             9\n  4 - good                 0       2           3       18            11\n  5 - very good            1       0           9       30            11\n\n\nObservation: Among females, the most common combination was very good health status and good family relations, with 30 students reporting this.

In general, it appears that most rural students report good family relations, and within that group, many also report good health.\n• Create a two-way contingency table using group_by() and summarize() from dplyr.

While a small group of students who reported going out with friends very frequently also reported very good health, the majority of students in the very good health category reported lower levels of going out with friends.\n\n\n\nNumeric variables (and across groups)\nThe numeric variables are age, absences, and the three test grades variables (G1, G2, and G3) from each data set (Math and Portuguese)."
